Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In addition to the honor, prestige, and substantial prize money, the recipient also gets a gold medal with an image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who established the prize.\n\n![](Nobel_Prize.png)\n\nThe Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the outset of the awards from 1901 to 2023.
